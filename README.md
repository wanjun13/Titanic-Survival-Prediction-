# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-
I used the Kaggle's well known dataset: Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster to practice my Python machine learning skills.
As we would like to predict the survival (0 = not survived, 1 = survived) of Titanic event, I use Python's package statsmodels to conduct Logistic Regression.
I also do some data cleaning before building the model.

Lastly, I referred some brilliant ideas from Kaggle notebooks in my data cleaning step.
